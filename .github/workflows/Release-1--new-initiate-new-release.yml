            Hi @${{ github.actor }}!

            This PR was created in response to a manual trigger of the release workflow here: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}.
            I've bumped the versions in the manifest files in this commit: ${{ steps.make-commit.outputs.commit }}.

            Merging this PR will create a GitHub release and upload any assets that are created as part of the release build.

            Happy merging!
